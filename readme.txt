The Amilia Store allows you to embed your Amilia Store directly inside your website. You can also embed a redirection button, a table of activities and even a calendar of activities.

== Description ==

[Amilia](http://www.amilia.com) goes beyond online registration with features like an online store, a CRM database and a robust reporting module so you can spend more time developing stronger relationships with your community and your members or evolving new program ideas for them. Youâ€™ll have more time to grow your business now that all your day-to-day can be done with one complete software.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Amilia Store tool appears in your editor. It allows you to insert shortcodes to inject your Amilia store, a button, a table of activities or a calendar of activities. Click again to update or remove a shortcode.
2. When the page is previewed and published, the shortcodes are transformed into the desired component.
3. Also supports Gutenberg or WordPress 5 by introducing new Embed blocks.
